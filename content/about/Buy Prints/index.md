# Star Party Bookings

![starpartydemo](images/spsabino.JPEG)

Experience the night sky like never before with a private star party. Utilizing my large telescopes, I can provide fantastic views of the Moon, planets, star clusters, galaxies, nebulae, and more (most nebulae and galaxies will require reasonably dark conditions for a good view).

## Pricing & Details

I have telescopes available up to 22" in aperture as well as a PVS-7 night vision device for viewing nebulae even under fairly poor conditions.

Approximate pricing is as follows:

### Small Groups (25 or fewer guests)

- **$125 for 1 hour**
- **$200 for 2 hours**
- **$250 for 3 hours**

### Large Groups (over 25 guests) - contact for pricing & details

For events further outside Tucson/Pima County I am willing to travel for an additional cost.

*Pricing is subject to change depending on event specifics. Please contact me to discuss further details and requirements.*

## Telescope Repair and Assistance

In addition to star party bookings, I offer services for telescope repair and setup. Whether you need help fixing a telescope, or want guidance on using one for a night of stargazing, I am available to assist. Feel free to reach out for more information. For recommendations on choosing telescopes or accessories, I highly recommend visting telescopicwatch.com first before contacting me about further details. If you are in the Tucson or Phoenix area, I am happy to help in person.
