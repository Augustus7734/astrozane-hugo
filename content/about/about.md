## Introduction

I'm Zane Landers, a digital marketing and communications specialist. Most of my hobbies are pretty hands-on - whether it's stargazing, working on my Miata, or roller skating.

My professional experience spans multiple disciplines. Since 2017, I've been building, buying, repairing, and reselling telescopes, though I've stopped doing it as a full-on side hustle. This experience led me to work as a writer/editor for [TelescopicWatch](https://telescopicwatch.com) since 2018, where I review commercially manufactured telescopes and write guides for both beginners and experienced astronomers. I have done articles for other websites as well, and I am a frequent contributor to the [Cloudy Nights](https://www.cloudynights.com/) astronomy forum.

I've also worked as a communications/marketing intern for [NSF's NOIRLab](https://noirlab.edu/public/) and the [EUEC Convention](https://euec.com/). [See my resume for more details](https://astrozane.com/resume/).

I offer private stargazing events in the Tucson area, utilizing my large telescopes to provide breathtaking views of the night sky. Whether for individuals, families, or as a unique experience for corporate events, these sessions offer a personalized journey through the stars. I offer help with setting up and repairing telescopes as well. Feel free to visit my [booking page](https://astrozane.com/booking/).

## Astronomy Outreach

[I frequently do astronomy outreach events](https://astrozane.com/astronomy/astronomyoutreach/), both on my own and with astronomy clubs. You can often find me set up in downtown Tucson with one of my telescopes showing the Moon or planets to passerby [in the same manner John Dobson did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSTDLXYMQjg).

## Telescope Making

My true passion lies in building telescopes, particularly fast instruments with thin mirrors that push the boundaries of traditional optics wisdom and telescope design. One of my proudest achievements was winning a first-place award at Stellafane, the oldest and most prestigious amateur telescope making event in the United States, for my homemade [6" f/4.3 telescope and mirror](https://astrozane.com/projects/6inch-f4/).

I am particularly proud of my role in helping to design the [Hadley 114mm 3D-printed telescope](https://www.printables.com/model/224383-astronomical-telescope-hadley-an-easy-assembly-hig). Hadley represents a significant step towards making astronomy and telescope making more accessible. Hadley provides great deep-sky views but performs significantly better at high magnifications than many cheaper tabletop Dobsonians, at a cost less than most commercial instruments. You can [buy a kit from Jonathan Kissner](https://kissner-optik.netlify.app/) or print your own. Hadley's optics can be scavenged from many "hobby killer" telescopes with wobbly mounts, or you can buy the optics wholesale on Amazon or AliExpress. Virtually any 3d printer will allow you to build the structure, and all of the non-optical and non-printed bits can be found at your local hardware store.

Over the years, I've [owned more than 470 telescopes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10u__j-BPwaRjkedsvcIMpclY8nEwKfm2i86mk1ffOos/edit?usp=drive_link) and personally built about a dozen instruments from scratch. This extensive experience has given me unique insights into optical design, mechanical engineering, and the practical aspects of astronomical observation. I regularly share this knowledge by teaching mirror-making classes.

I have built Dobsonian telescopes as large as 24" and made optics as large as 16" at home. I am currently working on a [22" f/2.8 mirror and telescope](https://astrozane.com/projects/22inch-f28/), which will likely be the largest I go again unless I build a 1-meter with some friends. My [homemade 14.7" telescope](https://astrozane.com/projects/147-inch-f29/) has earned the distinction of being the [top post of all time on Reddit's r/space community](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/frdd1d/im_17_years_old_and_just_finished_building_this/), reaching millions of space enthusiasts worldwide.

## Telescope Restoration & Repairs

I'm passionate about preserving astronomical heritage and have restored telescopes dating back to the 1930s, carefully bringing these historical instruments back to working condition while maintaining their original character.

Some of the more exciting restoration projects I've done include:

* Fixing a 1931 JW Fecker 90mm refractor, including re-seating the lens, refinishing the legs, and a full repaint/polish with the help of Dana Weisbrot

* Repainting Celestron C8 #737 with the help of Dana Weisbrot

* Restoring a 1959 Criterion RV-6 including repolishing the original setting circles and rebuilding the clock drive as well as a full repaint of the tube/mount

* Refinishing and repainting a Tasco 10TE from the 1950s

* Repairing a 300-lb Edmund 8" f/8 Newtonian reflector

* Installing a new corrector plate in a Celestron C11 (which surprisingly worked quite well)

I provide telescope help and repairs as as service. For more information, [contact me](https://astrozane.com/links/contact/).

## Observational Astronomy

Since embarking on my journey into observational astronomy in 2015, I have dedicated myself to exploring the universe's vast mysteries. Despite not witnessing the full splendor of the Milky Way until several years later, my enthusiasm for observing deep-sky objects never wavered. From my Bortle 6 backyard, I embarked on the ambitious task of observing the Herschel 400 catalog, finishing in 2019.

The construction of my own telescopes has been pivotal in my exploration of the cosmos. Beginning with a 16" Dobsonian in 2018 and subsequently a 20.5" telescope, I was able to uncover intricate galactic structures and resolve faint globular clusters with exceptional detail. The evolution of my telescope-building journey led me to design a 10" f/3.2 and eventually my current 14.7" f/2.9 Dobsonian, optimized for wide-field views. Currently, I utilize my homemade 6" f/4.3 and 14.7" Dobs, alongside a Celestron C11.

Over the years, I have embraced opportunities to observe some of the most challenging and profound astronomical phenomena. One particularly memorable experience was witnessing the blinking of the Crab Pulsar (magnitude ~17.5) through a 32" telescope.

Furthermore, I actively engage with the astronomy community by participating in discussions on the Observational Astronomy Discord server. This platform serves as an invaluable resource for sharing insights and experiences, allowing me to connect with fellow enthusiasts from around the globe. Join the community at [discord.gg/astronomy](https://discord.gg/astronomy).

## Protecting Dark Skies

Deeply committed to the advocacy for dark skies, I am a proponent of initiatives like those championed by [DarkSky](https://www.darksky.org/). Preserving the darkness of the night sky is crucial for protecting the environment, as well as both recreational  and scientific astronomical pursuits.

I currently serve on the board of [DarkSky Southern Arizona](https://darkskysoaz.org/).
