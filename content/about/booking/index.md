# Star Party Bookings

![starpartydemo](images/spsabino.JPEG)

Experience the night sky like never before with a private star party. Utilizing my large telescopes, I can provide fantastic views of the Moon, planets, star clusters, galaxies, nebulae, and more (most nebulae and galaxies will require reasonably dark conditions for a good view). I have telescopes available up to 22" in aperture as well as a PVS-7 night vision device for viewing nebulae even under fairly poor conditions, such as the Horsehead Nebula in the image below:
