I was sent a Vaonis Vespera II smart telescope in July 2025. Here are some images I've taken with it. My review will be up shortly on TelescopicWatch.com.

These images were taken using the stock Vespera II with the included dual band/broadband filters, or unfiltered from a dark sky. Unless otherwise noted, I used 10s subs and did processing in the free Siril astroimage processing app.

These images load in full resolution by default thanks to the way my website is coded - if you're on a desktop, just right click to "open in new tab" - if you're on mobile, you can just zoom in or save the photos to your device.
