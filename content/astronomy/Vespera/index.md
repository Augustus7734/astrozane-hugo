I was sent a Vaonis Vespera II smart telescope in July 2025. Here are some images I've taken with it. [I have a review of it on TelescopicWatch.com](https://telescopicwatch.com/vaonis-vespera-ii-review/)

These images were taken using the stock Vespera II with the included dual band/broadband filters, or unfiltered from a dark sky. Unless otherwise noted, I used 10s subs and did processing in the free Siril astroimage processing app.

These should load in full resolution by default thanks to the way my website is coded - if you're on a desktop, just right click to "open in new tab" - if you're on mobile, you can just zoom in or save the photos to your device.
