In today's digitally saturated world, astronomy outreach, particularly in the form of impromptu sidewalk astronomy, provides invaluable experiences. It connects people with the cosmos in a direct, tangible way. While technology often mediates our interactions, gazing through a telescope offers a profound and memorable experience, tapping into the wonder and curiosity that screens frequently diminish. In a time when we are inundated with digital images, these can become just another moment in a sea of pixels. The sheer thrill of seeing the rings of Saturn or the craters on the Moon through a telescope often leaves a lasting impression, igniting a lifelong interest in science and exploration.
