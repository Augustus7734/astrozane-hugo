I have owned over 470 telescopes. [The full list is here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10u__j-BPwaRjkedsvcIMpclY8nEwKfm2i86mk1ffOos/edit?usp=drive_link)

Currently I observe with my 14.7" f/2.9 Dob and a Celestron C11 Schmidt-Cassegrain, with my 6" f/4.3 for wide-field views. Most of my other telescopes are used for outreach events or quick lunar/planetary views at home.

### John Dobson 8" f/6 built circa 1985
![8" Dobson](images/dobson.jpg)

Yes, this scope was built by *the* John Dobson himself. I have been told by several people they saw him using it around 1985 in San Francisco. It is extremely sharp optically. It was given to me at Stellafane 2021 and I have used it extensively since.

I added numerous upgrades such as a new ground board, helical 2" focuser, and a better mirror cell. Secondary mirror still is attached to a spider made out of roofing shingles.

## Maksutov-Cassegrains (MCT)
### Intes MK63 built 1992
![MK63](images/mk63.JPG)

One of the earliest Maksutovs to be imported from Russia shortly after the fall of the USSR, the Intes MK63 is the same telescope as the MK65 but with a fork mount and a 60mm f/25 Mak guide scope which I sold to a friend. I printed some hardware to fit the mount on a surveyor tripod, since the wooden one it came with was fragile and far from steady. Very good views, although there is some glare on account of a lack of secondary baffling. This scope has no internal focuser or rear-attached unit; focusing is accomplished with a helical threaded holder on the diagonal. Rather fast for a Maksutov at a focal ratio of f/10.

### Meade ETX-90RA built 1996

I have had a lot of ETXes; my first, like this one, was an RA unit with a non-working clock drive (thankfully this one lacks the fungus on the corrector which my first had). It has flown across the US with me and I can use it on both its #881 tabletop legs or the #884 heavy duty tripod.

### SarBlue Mak70 2022

I have 2 of these presently, the second was purchased for a video review. Very good lunar, planetary, and double star instruments.

## Refractors

### Meade #312 (80mm f/11) built late 1970s
![Meade80](images/meade80.jpeg)

I found this telescope on Craigslist. It is one of the best achromats I have used; the tube and mount were both made by Mizar in Japan. The mount is a little cumbersome to take apart so I mostly use it in my backyard. The Orion SkyView Deluxe (made by GSO) happens to be a near-exact copy of the Mizar mount so I took a polar scope and clock drive off one and put it on the 312.
