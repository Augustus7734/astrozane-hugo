I currently offer Hadley telescopes made-to-order for folks in the Tucson area. I also have some optics and other items listed for sale here.

[Many of the smaller telescopes and accessories I sell are available on my eBay page as well.](https://www.ebay.com/str/astrozane)

For more details or to inquire about purchasing an item, please [contact me](https://astrozane.com/links/contact).

## Telescopes - Local Pickup Only

### Hadley 114mm f/8 - $400.00

I am one of the original co-designers of Hadley, and I currently have 3 units available. I can order optics for more. These are printed out of high-grade ASA plastic, with non-rotating helical focusers, optics tested by me, and a pair of Plossl eyepieces included.

## Telescope Optics - Shipping Available

### 18.75" f/6 Primary Mirror - $500.00

This is a 1" thick plate glass primary mirror made in a John Dobson mirror making class in the 1970s. Figure is quite good, apart from a central "hole" which will be obstructed by the secondary mirror anyway.

### 16.5" x 1" Plate Glass Mirror Blank - $200.00

Has some chips, but only on one side. Would make an excellent primary mirror.

### 9" x 0.5" Quartz Mirror Blank - $50.00

This is from a semiconductor project of some sort. Very low thermal expansion and about as stiff as a 3/4" thick glass blank. Unused.
