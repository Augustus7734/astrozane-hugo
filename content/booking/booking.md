# Star Party Bookings

Experience the night sky like never before with a private star party. Utilizing my large telescopes, I can provide fantastic views of the Moon, planets, star clusters, galaxies, nebulae, and more (deep-sky objects will require reasonably dark conditions for a good view). My current assortment of larger telescopes includes a 13.1" Dobsonian and a Celestron C11 Schmidt-Cassegrain.

I also have telescopes for daytime solar viewing.

Approximate pricing is as follows:

- **$100 for 1 hour**
- **$150 for 2 hours**
- **$200 for 3 hours**

For events further outside Tucson I am willing to travel for an additional cost.

*Pricing is subject to change depending on event specifics.*
