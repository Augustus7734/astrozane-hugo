## Mk 25/30, latest version

![Mk XXV](images/mk25.JPEG)

My "small" Dobsonian telescope. Constructed and modified between December 2019 and May 2025, this instrument is designed to do everything: wide-field vistas, sharp planetary views, and deep views of galaxies and globular clusters. The primary mirror is 0.8" thick quartz and made by Nova Optical.  The secondary is a 3.1" Antares unit, accurate to 1/20 wave.

The whole telescope weighs just 45 pounds, and fits in my passenger seat if I need it to. It can be assembled in as little as five minutes. Tracking is provided by a Poncet equatorial platform. With a 21mm Ethos eyepiece, I can get a 1.7-degree true field of view - 3.5 full Moons across! 

The most recent major changes I made to the scope were in May 2025; I added whiffletrees machined by a friend to properly support the edge of the mirror and repainted some of the rocker box. It finally has sharp stars after 5 years.
