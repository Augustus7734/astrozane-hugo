# Restoration Projects

## 1931 JW Fecker 3.5" Restoration

A scope I restored for the Westport Astronomical Society with the help of Dana Weisbrot. Dana tackled the hardware and OTA while I cleaned the optics and legs. The scope works well and provides beautiful images despite its age.

## Celestron 1972 C8 Tri-Color Restoration

This scope came to me in incredibly bad shape, with dirty optics, a non-functional clock drive, and ruined paint. I restored it to perfect condition in 2019 and repainted it with the help of Dana Weisbrot of Twin Ridge Auto Body (and fellow WAS member). The scope now resides in the hands of Gianluca Carlinci in Italy, along with a 1971 C8 which I also sold to him that awaits a similar restoration.

## 1959 Criterion RV6 Restoration

A scope I restored with the help of Dana Weisbrot, who painted the tube and finder while I did the rest.
